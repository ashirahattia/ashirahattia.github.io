				I am writing this letter to apply for a summer internship at Squarespace.  I am a computer science major and communication designer, and there are few companies that so perfectly embody to me the meeting point between design and engineering. (after all, where else do phrases like "design is not a luxury" and "build beautiful tools" appear in a company manifesto?). I would love the opportunity to be part of a team that is so committed to making high quality, intuitive and beautiful web design universally available.
			</p>
			<p>
				Through my coursework at UC Berkeley, I have developed a firm grounding in important concepts of computer science, good software design, and maximized performance, and have gained extensive practical coding knowledge. While at university, I have also had the chance to immerse myself in graphic design, and expand my understanding of visual thinking and problem solving.  But there is only so much one can learn in a classroom. Engineering, to me, means creating. It is about discovering a problem, and then finding an elegant solution. My goal now is to take my classroom knowledge out into the world and use it to actually build something meaningful, for a purpose that I believe in.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a team member, I can offer reliability, commitment to quality, and unending enthusiasm for learning new things. I can promise to ask for help, but never answers, and to hold myself and my work to the highest of standards. I have gained experience both in leadership and in collaboration through leading a graphic design team and building technology projects with my peers. I strive to always think outside the dodecahedron. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Above all, my ultimate goal in life is and always has been to make the world a more elegant, useable place. I want to build products that make other people's lives easier and more beautiful, and I can think of no better place to start than Squarespace.
