					I'm currently studying CS & design at UC Berkeley, as well as working towards a minor in creative writing. I love art, tea, and big cities. I love solving problems, learning new things and technology that improves people's lives.

					But most importantly, I love words. I love reading, I love writing, and I love books. I love the way books create worlds and people. The way books transcend time and space. The way books use stories to say incredible, philosophical and important things about the world we live in.
				</div>

				<div class = "caption">
					<br>Some of my favorite books, by the way, are <b>Stardust</b> by Neil Gaiman, <b>The Things They Carried</b> by Tim O'Brien, <b>The Lowland</b> by Jhumpa Lahiri, and (I am, after all, a millenial), <b>Harry Potter</b>.

					The long and short of it is, I would love the opportunity to do a summer internship at Oyster. I can promise to work hard, learn fast, teach myself, and ask questions. I can promise to hold myself to the highest standards, to be a team player, and to dedicate myself to the company and product.

					My ultimate goal has always been to build products that people use, and makes their lives easier. The Oyster team does all of that, with the added bonus of working with the three most important things in my life, engineering, design, and words, so I can think of no place I'd rather be.
					<br><br>Sincerely, 
					<br>Angira Shirahatti
