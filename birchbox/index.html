					I also love solving problems, learning new things, and technology that improves people's lives. When I think about Birchbox, I think about a company that is taking the possibilities technology presents in providing services that make peopleâ€™s lives easier to a whole new level. After all, what could be more delightful than receiving a box of useful goodies every month in the mail? So naturally, I would love the opportunity to be a part of a team like Birchbox's.

					In short, I would love the opportunity to do a summer internship at Birchbox. I can promise to work hard, learn fast, teach myself, and ask questions. I can promise to hold myself to the highest standards, to be a team player, and to dedicate myself to the company and product.

					My ultimate goal has always been to build products that people use, and makes their lives easier. The Birchbox team does exactly that, and I would like nothing better than to be part of it.
