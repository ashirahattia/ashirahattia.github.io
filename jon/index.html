            Dear Jon,
        </div>
        <div class = "letter">
            <p>As I had anticipated, the last 43 days have not been the greatest. I miss you all the time, and I worry about you all the time, and sometimes the fact that I can't touch you makes me want to throw things. </p>

            <p>But today something wonderful happened. Today, I got an offer from Shapeways, so that it is now guaranteed that I will be in New York with you this summer, and you have no idea how deliriously happy that makes me, however much my stupid brain might want to make me sad. It can't keep me sad because the thought of spending an entire summer eating with you and sleeping next to you and spending weekends exploring and staying home with you makes me feel as though I'm floating on a cloud. <i>You</i> make me feel like I'm floating on a cloud, and sometimes I just don't know what to do with all the happiness inside me so I end up with an overflow error and become sad. Like I said, my brain is stupid.
            </p>

            <p>Actually, I'll be honest, I'm crying a little bit right now, but I'm pretty sure these are tears of joy, and there will be more of them when I see you at the airport on March 20th, so just like prepare yourself. 
            </p>  

            <p>Also I'm not sorry at all for the terrible CS reference. Not even a little bit. Okay, maybe a little bit.
            </p>

            <p>But mostly, I just wanted to put it down in writing somewhere you can see how happy you make me. How much I love you. How glad I am that you love me too (see, I'm learning slowly! I convinced myself not only that you exist, but also that you love me, aren't you proud? :P). I can't wait to go for romantic walks in the park with you. We'll probably feel ridiculous the whole time, but we're going to do it anyway, okay? I can't wait to see 4th of July fireworks with you. When the first one goes off, I'm going to kiss you, so you won't be able to see it. Consider yourself warned. I can't wait to eat ramen with you, and drink coconut water with you, and cook with you, and be lazy and get take out with you. I can't wait to get lost in the city with you, and go shopping with you, and watch House of Cards with you. I can't wait to be your seatbelt, whenever you want one. We're going to have an amazing summer, because we're going to be together, and I can't wait.
            </p> 

            <p>I love you, I love you, I love you.</p>

        	Dear Jon,
    	</div>
    	<div class = "letter">
       		<p> You know, if you google "Dear John" you'll discover a really, 
			really terrible Nicholas Sparks movie, and also that "Dear John" 
			letter was the name commonly used for break-up letters sent to 
			soldiers by their wives/girlfriends. So I guess it's a good thing 
			your name isn't John, and this isn't really a letter. </p>

   			<p> Actually, there was a point at which I did consider writing 
			you an actual letter on actual paper, but, this is much cleaner and
			more efficient in every way. Also there's no way for this to 
			get destroyed by rain or fire or spilled coffee, or even (thanks to 
			my google docs backup and all those redundant data centers) an act of God. 
			Also hyperlinks. </p>

			<p> Anyway, the fact that you're reading this means that I'm no longer in 
			LA, which means it's going to be a few months before we see each other again. 
			This, in my opinion, is more than a little repugnant, ghastly, distasteful, etc, 
			but I was the one who made my bed, and now I must lie in it. I'm really sorry 
			for dragging you along, and I know you're snorting or something right now because 
			you think I apologize too much, but I'm going to do it anyway. The next few months 
			will probably be less than great, and for that I am truly, deeply sorry. 
			To mitigate my guilt some, I have come up with a few things that 
            I'd like for us to do to make this whole "long distance" thing slightly 
            less awful. These are compiled 
            <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1raAxAt0e4ehyyq_ZgHjlEMQMoWrPhvy7_x_p7pGFIZ8/edit?usp=sharing" target = "_blank">here</a> 
            (see? Hyperlinks!). </p>

			<p> It still happens every now and then that someone will ask me how we met, or
             what I like about you, or why I get that stupid, disgustingly happy look on my 
            face when I talk about you (Thanh Hien's words, not mine), and although I try 
            to explain, I can never quite seem to capture how great it is for me that I have 
            you. How great it is to have someone I trust so absolutely, who I always feel 
            like I can talk to, who always, without fail, makes my day better, and makes 
            scary things seem less scary (the personal heater is good too).</p>

            <p>In any case, having you is really nice, and I really do hope that having me 
            is even half as nice for you as having you is for me. </p>

			<p>Also I hope you didn't have to re-read that sentence too many times. 
            I tried to make it better, but I couldn't.</p>

			<p>So basically, long story short, tl;dr, I love you. Like a lot. 
            Like, really, no joke, <i>a lot,</i> and I am unbelievably glad that you live 
            and breathe and  walk around and stuff. Thanks for doing that, I appreciate it.
            </p>

			<p>Okay, that's all, I think. </p>
