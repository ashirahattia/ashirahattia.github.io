					I also love solving problems, learning new things, and technology that improves people's lives. I know I'm not the only one in the world that loves learning new things, and I truly believe that there is nothing more important and valuable in this world than education. There is nothing more awe-inspiring or magical than learning something new.

					The long and short of it is, I would love the opportunity to do a summer internship at Knewton. I can promise to work hard, learn fast, teach myself, and ask questions. I can promise to hold myself to the highest standards, to be a team player, and to dedicate myself to the company and product.

					My ultimate goal has always been to build products that people use, and makes their lives easier and more fulfilling. The Knewton team does exactly that, and I would like nothing better than to be part of it.
