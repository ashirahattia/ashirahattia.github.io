			<h1> About me </h1>
			<p>
				I got into design at the tender age of 11, when my neopet's homepage just wasn't sparkly enough. I read some tutorials on how to hack HTML tables and never looked back.
			</p>
			<p>
				In my spare time I listen to books, drink tea, and eat tasty food. In fact, the majority of my life revolves around eating tasty food. You can read my thoughts on audiobooks on <a href="https://medium.com/@ashirahatti" target="_blank">Medium</a>, or see my would-be artsy photos on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ashirahattia/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.
