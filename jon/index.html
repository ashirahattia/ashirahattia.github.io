        	Dear Jon,
    	</div>
    	<div id = "letter">
       		<p> You know, if you google "Dear John" you'll discover a really, 
			really terrible Nicholas Sparks movie, and also that "Dear John" 
			letter was the name commonly used for break-up letters sent to 
			soldiers by their wives/girlfriends. So I guess it's a good thing 
			your name isn't John, and this isn't really a letter. </p>

   			<p> Actually, there was a point at which I did consider writing 
			you an actual letter on actual paper, but, this is much cleaner and
			more efficient in every way. Also there's no way for this to 
			get destroyed by rain or fire or spilled coffee, or even (thanks to 
			my google docs backup and all those redundant data centers) an act of God. 
			Also hyperlinks. </p>

			<p> Anyway, the fact that you're reading this means that I'm no longer in 
			LA, which means it's going to be a few months before we see each other again. 
			This, in my opinion, is more than a little repugnant, ghastly, distasteful, etc, 
			but I was the one who made my bed, and now I must lie in it. I'm really sorry 
			for dragging you along, and I know you're snorting or something right now because 
			you think I apologize too much, but I'm going to do it anyway. The next few months 
			will probably be less than great, and for that I am truly, deeply sorry. 
			To appease my guilty conscience, I have come up with a few things that 
            I'd like for us to do to make this whole "long distance" thing slightly 
            less awful. These are compiled 
            <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1raAxAt0e4ehyyq_ZgHjlEMQMoWrPhvy7_x_p7pGFIZ8/edit?usp=sharing" target = "_blank">here</a> 
            (see? Hyperlinks!). </p>

			<p> It still happens every now and then that someone will ask me how we met, or
             what I like about you, or why I get that stupid, disgustingly happy look on my 
            face when I talk about you (Thanh Hien's words, not mine), and although I try 
            to explain, I can never quite seem to capture how nice it is for me that I have 
            you. How nice it is to have someone I trust so absolutely, who I always feel 
            like I can talk to, who always, without fail, makes my day better, and makes 
            scary things seem less scary. The personal heater is nice too. In any case,    
			having you is really nice, and I really do hope that having me is even half 
            as nice for you as having you is for me. </p>

			<p>Also I hope you didn't have to re-read that sentence too many times. 
            I tried to make it better, but I couldn't.</p>

			<p>So basically, long story short, tl;dr, I love you. Like a lot. 
            Like, really, no joke, <i>a lot.</i> Also I'm going to miss you <i>a lot</i>, 
            and I am unbelievably glad that you live and breathe and  walk around and stuff.
            </p>

			<p>Okay, that's all, I think. </p>
