					I also love solving problems, learning new things, and technology that improves people's lives. I also believe that food is the foundation of family, culture, happiness, and comfort. So naturally, I would love the opportunity to be a part of a team like GrubHub's, that is committed to making sure that users always have access to that perfect, completely satisfying bite.

					In short, I would love the opportunity to do a summer internship a GrubHub. I can promise to work hard, learn fast, teach myself, and ask questions. I can promise to hold myself to the highest standards, to be a team player, and to dedicate myself to the company and product.

					My ultimate goal has always been to build products that people use, and makes their lives easier. The Grubhub team does exactly that, and I would like nothing better than to be part of it.
